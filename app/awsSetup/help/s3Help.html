    	Configuring S3 locations requires a total of 2 buckets, one serves as the source and one 
    	as the destination.  The source is where the blender project will be placed for the workers
    	to pull.  The destination is where the frames will be placed once the workers have processed
    	each task in the queue.
    </p>

    <h4>Source Bucket</h4>
    <p>
    	To setup the source, a bucket needs to be created and the blender project will need to be bundled
    	and uploaded.  
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Log in to AWS and click on S3</li>
    	<li>If a source bucket does not already exist, click the "Create Bucket" button and follow the prompts to create one</li>
    	<li>Bundle the project for upload by running a command similar to the following:
    		<br>
    		<code>tar cfzv myproject.tar.gz myproject</code>
    		<br>
    		In the above example replace "myproject" with the name of your project.
    		<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Before bundling the project, ensure 
    			references to resources are using relative paths so the workers will be able to find them
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			Upload the bundled project to S3 using the AWS console by selecting the bucket in S3 and 
			selecting Actions --> Upload and follow the prompts
		</li>
		<li>
			Fill the "Project Location" field with 
			<br>
			<code>s3://&lt;BUCKET_NAME&gt;/&lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;</code>
			<br>
			Where &lt;BUCKET_NAME&gt; is the source bucket name and &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt; is the bundled up project name from above
			<br>
			<small>Example: s3://&lt;source_bucket&gt;/&lt;myproject.tar.gz&gt;</small>
		</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h4>Destination Bucket</h4>
    <p>
    	The destination bucket is where the workers will place the completed frames.  The bucket can be created by simply
    	logging into AWS, clicking S3 and clicking the "Create Bucket" button and following the prompts.
	</p>
	<p>
    	Once the bucket is created, populate the "Frame Destination Bucket" field with the bucket in the format:
    	<br>
    	<code>s3://BUCKET_NAME</code>
    	<br>
    	Where BUCKET_NAME is the name of the destination bucket.
