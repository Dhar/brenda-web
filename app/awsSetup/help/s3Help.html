    	Configuring S3 locations requires a total of 2 buckets, one serves as the source and one 
    	as the destination.  The source is where the blender project will be placed for the workers
    	to pull.  The destination is where the frames will be placed once the workers have processed
    	each task in the queue.
    </p>

    <h4>Destination Bucket</h4>
    <p>
    	The destination bucket is where the workers will place the completed frames.  The bucket can be created by simply
    	logging into AWS, clicking S3 and clicking the "Create Bucket" button and following the prompts.
	</p>
	<p>
    	Once the bucket is created, populate the "Frame Destination Bucket" field with the bucket in the format:
    	<br>
    	<code>s3://BUCKET_NAME</code>
    	<br>
    	Where BUCKET_NAME is the name of the destination bucket.
