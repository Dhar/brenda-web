    	<li>If you haven't already done so, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">create an AWS account</a></li>
    	<li>Create an AWS access key and secret by following the instructions <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
    	<li>Enter the access key and secret into the appropriate input fields</li>
    	<li>Specify the region you'd like to use.  For more information about AWS regions, see the documentation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions" target="_blank">here</a></li>

    <p>
    	Clicking "Set Credentials" will cause the tool to test the provided credentials agains AWS.  If this is your first
    	time using the tool (or first time within the provided region), the security group check is likely to fail.  Clicking 
    	the "fix it" link that appears will let the tool attempt to create the security group in AWS. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	To see the details of the created security group, it can be found by going to AWS then EC2 --> Security Groups
    	Here, you should see a security group named "brenda-web".  This is the security group that was created and you can
    	see the details of what was created.
