    	Brenda-web utilizes two types of instance requests from the AWS EC2 offerings, spot or on demand.
	</p>
	<p>
    	On demand instances can be created as necessary and will continue to operate until the job is
    	complete or the instance is terminated by the user.  On demand instances are charged per hour at
    	a flat rate as described <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Spot instances allow a user to bid on unused EC2 capacity and can generally be run at a significantly
    	discounted price as compared to on demand instances.  The spot price fluctuates as a function of supply
    	and demand over time.  As long as the spot price is below the price that was bid, the instances will
    	continue to run.  If the spot price rises above the bid price, the instances will be terminated.  Any
    	tasks that were being processed by a terminated worker will be returned to the work queue for later
    	completion.  The latest spot price will be listed under the instance name for convenience.
