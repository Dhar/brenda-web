		<h3>Brenda-Web Tutorial</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			This tutorial will demonstrate the process for setting up AWS, submitting jobs and monitoring their progress.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We assume you already have an AWS account and, for the sake of this tutorial, that it is brand new with nothing
			configured.  If you have previously used Brenda, some of the steps may not be required.  In general, the tool
			and configurations will happily live along side any other unrelated AWS resources without issues.  If you'd like
			further isolation, AWS allows for the creation of linked accounts.  The configuration of linked accounts is beyond
			the scope of this tutorial but additional details can be found 
			<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To completely understand what is happening in this tutorial, we recommend logging in to the AWS console and observing the 
			changes being made and resources being utilized.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To assist with managing files in S3 buckets, a number of tools are available for uploading/downloading files from your S3
			buckets.  For the sake of this tutorial we utilize the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> 
			tool however any tool of choice can be leveraged, including the AWS web interface.

			<h3>Start Workers</h3>
			
			<p>
				The workers are the AWS EC2 instances that will perform the work of rendering the frames.  On boot
				the workers will copy the Blender project from the source bucket.  Once the machine is up and running,
				they will start pulling tasks from the work queue.  Upon completion of each task, the results will be
				posted to the destination S3 bucket.

					Enter the ID of the AMI image you'd like to use.  Optionally you can click on the links below the
					select box to auto populate the ID of the selected AMI.
				</li>
				<li>
					Select whether to use spot or on demand instances.  On demand are charged at the static price set
					by Amazon whereas spot instances are bids for unused capacity.
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the size of the EC2 instance to be used.  
					See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>
					for more information.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you selected to run spot instances, a field for <strong>Spot Price</strong> will be present.  Enter
					the amount you want to bid for the spare capacity of the instance size you selected.  The latest spot
					price for the instance size you chose will be shown below the text box for convenience.
				</li>
				<li>Specify how many instance you want to start up in the <strong>Instance Count</strong> field</li>
				<li>Optionally specify a SSH key if you need to log in to the workers for any reason</li>
				<li>Click the <strong>Request Instances</strong> button to send your request to AWS</li>
