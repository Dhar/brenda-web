		<h3>Brenda-Web Tutorial</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			This tutorial will demonstrate the process for setting up AWS, submitting jobs and monitoring their progress.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We assume you already have an AWS account and, for the sake of this tutorial, that it is brand new with nothing
			configured.  If you have previously used Brenda, some of the steps may not be required.  In general, the tool
			and configurations will happily live along side any other unrelated AWS resources without issues.  If you'd like
			further isolation, AWS allows for the creation of linked accounts.  The configuration of linked accounts is beyond
			the scope of this tutorial but additional details can be found 
			<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To completely understand what is happening in this tutorial, we recommend logging in to the AWS console and observing the 
			changes being made and resources being utilized.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To assist with managing files in S3 buckets, a number of tools are available for uploading/downloading files from your S3
			buckets.  For the sake of this tutorial we utilize the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> 
			tool however any tool of choice can be leveraged, including the AWS web interface.

			<h3>Setup Tasks</h3>
			
			<p>
				We'll now populate the work queue with a list of tasks.  For this, we leverage a work template which defines
				the basic structure of the tasks.  The template is expanded to a list of tasks by specifying the start and end 
				frames.  The default template is:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>blender -b *.blend -F PNG -o $OUTDIR/frame_###### -s $START -e $END -j $STEP -t 0 -a</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				This template tells the workers to render each frame of the project as a single task.  The start and end frame
				inputs specify which frames are to be rendered.  Set the values as appropriate for the start and end frames.  The
				<strong>Work List</strong> shows the expanded list of tasks that will be enqueued.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once the template, start frame and end frame are configured as desired, click the <strong>Queue Work</strong>
				button.  This will send the tasks to the selected queue and the progress bar will be updated to reflect the
				status.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The current size of the queue can be seen below the queue selection drop down.  If a mistake was made, you may use the
				<strong>Clear Queue</strong> button to clear all tasks from the queue.
