	Execute the given Python script after loading the file for each frame
</p>
<p>
When the scene has been successfully loaded, the Python execution is being run. This happens before Blender switches 
to the scene to be rendered, so whatever you send as a command can potentially run on a different scene than expected. 
An example script line can be seen below:
</p>
<p>
	<code>bpy.ops.render.set_sampling(scene='ALL', device='GPU', samples=25, percentage=100, branched=False, 
	clamping=True, max_bounces=8, transparent_max_bounces=6,use_all_resources=False, cpu_tile_size=32)</code>
</p>
<p>
The code above runs a custom operator (bpy.ops.render.set_sampling) which is developed by Kiska and installed on the AMIs 
provided with <strong>brenda-web</strong>. There is a number of options that can be set, each one described on this help page. 
Note that the <code>import bpy</code> statement is automatically inserted to the frame template.
</p>

<p>The available options are</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>scene:</strong> 'ALL' or 'CURRENT'</li>
	<li><strong>device:</strong> 'GPU' or 'CPU'</li>
	<li><strong>use_all_resources:</strong> <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, default <code>False</code>. This allows 
											using both GPU and CPU for rendering. Only enable for really heavy scenes.</li>
	<li><strong>samples:</strong> number of <strong>squared</strong> samples</li>
	<li><strong>max_bounces:</strong> number of max total bounces</li>
	<li><strong>min_bounces:</strong> number of min total bounces</li>
	<li><strong>transparent_max_bounces:</strong> number of transparent max bounces</li>
	<li><strong>transparent_min_bounces:</strong> number of transparent min bounces</li>
	<li><strong>transmission_bounces:</strong> number of max transmission bounces</li>
	<li><strong>percentage:</strong>  render size percentage, relative to image resolution setting in file</li>
	<li><strong>cpu_tile_size:</strong> cpu tile size to use. For GPU this will be multiplied by 4 in case of path tracing, 
		and by 8 in case of branched path tracing, and automatically counter corrected when <code>use_all_resources</code> is set 
		to <code>True</code></li>
	<li><strong>branched:</strong> <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, default <code>False</code>. Triggers branched path tracing/li>
	<li><strong>clamping:</strong> <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, default <code>False</code>. Enables indirect and direct clamping. 
										Values are set rather high to avoid losing too much light, while still removing some fireflies</li>
	<li><strong>force_supported:</strong> <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, default <code>False</code>. Force the <strong>SUPPORTED</strong> 
										feature set, even if the user had set it to <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong></li>
	
</ol>

<p>
You can also, if you need to, add multiple scripts to your Work Template. Just copy and paste the 
<code>--python-expr "code here"</code> section and place it whereever needed. Note that Blender executes the given
batch commands in the order that they are given. More info can be found on 
https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/workflows/command_line.html?highlight=command%20line
